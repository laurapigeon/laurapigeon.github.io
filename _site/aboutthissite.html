                    <p>hihi! so ive finally committed to properly working on getting this website into a form that i can consistently add pages to, to do things like document my various curios and leave breadcrumb trails for people learning similarly obscure things as i</p>

<p>the site itself closely follows the visual style of hypnospace outlaw, a game i couldnt recommend more highly, but wouldnt want to spoil the experience of by trying to boil it down. suffice to say i loved it enough to spend weeks trying to match the aesthetic in my blocky graphics and crawling ant links, despite css and js really not liking that</p>

<p data-url="https://github.com/laurapigeon/laurapigeon.github.io">to take a look at my style sheets and java scripts used to produce this mess, navigate to the public github repo for this project linked over this paragraph</p>

<p data-url="/contact">if you have further questions about the process or want to make your own site in this style, id be more than happy to help out, and you can contact me in one of many places linked in my contacts page</p>

<p>making a site via pages is REALLY EASY and i think more people absolutely should give it a go, if anything to counter the relience on biggo companiesâ€™ lamesites (tw*tter, f*cebook, r*ddit, y**tube) for expressing yourself in the streamlined simplified corporate way they require. ironic (wrong use?) that i say this from a bunch of plain white paragraphs of text, but the creative capabilities of a website are astounding and id love to see what people can do with it. it is funny to me that websites used to be the primary means of interaction on the web (after forums?), but now that theyre more accessible than ever i nearly never see anyone linking them in profiles and going all-out with them. i maybe blame education for struggling to catch up, though thats 100% a funding issue</p>

<p>about my writing style: to consistently engage with this project i will have to predominantly use my informal tongue and formatting, which will likely mean cryptids for capitals and run-on sentences with only necessary punctuation. sorry. (to potential employers, lol, this doesnt mean i cant write up a mean report in formal english dialect with propah grammar, just that im currently learning a new keyboard layout and so am focussing predominantly on words to help improve my typing speed). additionally, im not going to proofread the discussion (non-resource) pages, so apologies for oddities</p>

<p>for people who have trouble reading the font, im working on adding a toggle to remove the font pixel effects to hopefully improve accessibility in that regard. a stretch goal would be a little hypii on the corner to read out a paragraph when ctrl-clicked. ill have to see what i can do about that :3</p>
