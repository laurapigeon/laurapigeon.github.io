i make music!! WOO!

i enjoy the music i make, but i cant make much of it. i treat it like a puzzle, setting myself a limitation with time signature or polyrhythm or such and see how nice i can get it. i cant do lyrics tho, but it would be cool i think

i still havent really settled on a daw yet, and i wouldnt be able to spend a lot on one. furnace (the tracker) looks cool
