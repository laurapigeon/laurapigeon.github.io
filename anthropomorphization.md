I think my opinions on this might be rarer than I thought.

I really like when the inhuman nature of creatures is put in focus, and appreciated.

There\'s so much that differs even the current living residents of the animal kingdom, why boil all that difference down under voyeur\-imposed/projected expression, identity and cuteness?

Probably the most mainstream example of this sort of point can be seen with regards to household pets. The focus of the cat or dog as \"part of the family\" runs in opposition to acknowledgement of its harmful behaviour like hunting and killing smaller wildlife or barking/biting aggressively. People draw attention to the danger from pets to the owner to try to shine a light on this, but usually the projection of personality, civility and understanding trumps that realisation. I don\'t think drawing attention to the potential harm of the animal will ever be the right direction to approach this. Harms and responsibilities to and from animals in pet ownership are a whole separate system that cannot be tackled on an individual case basis.

This is instead about the understanding of animals as differently individual, differently intelligent, differently capable, differently perceptive, worthy of respect and empathy and importance THROUGH their differences from us. I think that this is much more a cultural and language based issue. Ties between cultural performance (\"they talk and act like me\") and respectability are unfortunately ubiquitous in the modern day, in class and gender politics, xenophobia, ablism, in hiring practices, in academia and education, and all sorts of day-to-day encounters. Performance is very often a shorthand in place of personality, identity, individuality, opinions, preferences, wants and needs, which limits potential expression based on the culture\'s precepts and one\'s ability.

To get away from the incessant listing which can make the discussion hard to parse linearly, I\'ll refer to some most prominant examples of this with regards to animals to me.
